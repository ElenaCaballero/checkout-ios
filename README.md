# Payoneer iOS SDK

⚠️ Framework is on development stage.

## Installation

### CocoaPods
CocoaPods is one of dependency managers. For usage and installation instructions, visit [their website](https://cocoapods.org). To integrate the framework into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Payoneer', :git => 'https://github.com/optile/ios-sdk', :branch => 'develop'
```

## Example
We prepared an example application where you could try our framework. To launch it complete these steps:

1. Install local dependency using:
  ```bash
cd Example
pod install
```

2. Open `Example/Example.xcworkspace` file in XCode.

## Customizing the UI

You may customize the appearance of payment screens by using `Theme.shared` singleton:

```swift
Theme.shared.errorTextColor = .orange
```

Default values are stored in `Theme.standard` object.
